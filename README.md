# TF2 config files
My TF2 configuration files, and some custom

(ps: this config uses very low settings, it's completely tweaked for maximum performance, which is the only thing i care about)

# Launch options
```
-dxlevel 81 -novid -nojoy -nosteamcontroller -nohltv -particles 1 -precachefontchars -noquicktime +violence_ablood 0 +violence_agibs 0 +violence_hblood 0 +violence_hgibs 0 +violence_ablood 0 +violence_agibs 0 +violence_hblood 0 +violence_hgibs 0
```
remove the dxlevel option after first launch, u only need to do it once
